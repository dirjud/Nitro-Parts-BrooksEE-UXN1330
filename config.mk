# these params allow you to customize the clock speed of the dram
# The dram can operate from 125mhz to 300mhz.
# The PLL_ADV that generates the dram clock generates a 2x clock
# that is then divided by 2 to get the dram clock output.
# The multiplier you specify here is multipled 2x internally to
# calculate the 2x clock so these multipliers must generate the actual
# clock speed you wish.
#
# Constraints (ug382)
#  VCO of the PLL must be in the 400-1000mhz range.  You need to 
#  remember the internal clock 2x multiplier when considering this.
#  Result is your VCO output has to be in the 200-500mhz range. 

#  You can get results below 200mhz for the dram by using UXN1330_MEMCLK_DIV2
#  which further devides VCO after the first constraint is met.
#
#  always specify UXN1330_IFCLK_FREQ in terms of mhz in order to 
#  allow the PLL to synthesize

#  UXN1330_MEMCLK_DIV=1 # leave 1 to meet vco constraint.
#  UXN1330_MEMCLK_DIV2=2 # 300 / 2 = 150mhz dram clock
